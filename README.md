# object-store

An S3-compatible object store that keeps objects on the local filesystem. It is
built to stand in for S3 in local development and end-to-end tests: point an
AWS SDK at it and the usual bucket, object, multipart and presigned-URL calls
work.

It is not a production object store. There is one storage root on one machine,
no replication, and listings read the bucket's whole key index on every call.

## Running it

With Docker:

```sh
docker run --rm -p 9000:9000 -v s3data:/data \
  -e TULE_Auth_AccessKeyID=test -e TULE_Auth_SecretAccessKey=test \
  -e TULE_Storage_Buckets=uploads,assets \
  ghcr.io/tulehq/object-store:latest
```

The image is based on Alpine, so `docker exec -it <container> sh` gives you a
shell. It runs as the unprivileged `nonroot` user, and its Docker health check
polls `/_ready`.

From source (Go 1.27):

```sh
make build
TULE_Auth_AccessKeyID=test TULE_Auth_SecretAccessKey=test ./build/tule-object-store
```

It listens on port 9000.

## Configuration

Settings come from environment variables prefixed with `TULE_`, and from a
`.env` file in the working directory (without the prefix).

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TULE_Server_Port` | `9000` | Listen port |
| `TULE_Storage_RootDir` | `./data` (`/data` in the image) | Where buckets and objects are stored |
| `TULE_Storage_Buckets` | unset | Comma-separated buckets to create at startup, if missing |
| `TULE_HSTS_MaxAge` | unset | `Strict-Transport-Security` max age; the header is only sent when set |
| `TULE_Server_Domain` | `localhost` | Enables virtual-hosted-style requests to `<bucket>.<domain>` |
| `TULE_Auth_AccessKeyID` | required | The access key clients sign requests with |
| `TULE_Auth_SecretAccessKey` | required | Its secret |
| `TULE_GasEnv` | | `development` logs at trace level, `testing` disables logging |

The server refuses to start without credentials, and every request must be
signed with them (SigV4) or carry a presigned URL made with them. Any web page
you visit can send requests to a server on localhost; signatures are what stop
it from using this one.

## Health checks

`GET /_health` (liveness) and `GET /_ready` (readiness) answer without a
signature. They respond `200` when every service reports healthy or ready and
`503` otherwise, with a JSON object of each service's status. Readiness fails
when the storage root cannot be read.

Startup buckets are created before the server listens, so once either probe
answers, they exist.

## Connecting a client

Use any region; buckets report `us-east-1`. Path-style addressing always
works. Virtual-hosted style works when the client can resolve
`<bucket>.<TULE_Server_Domain>` to the server.

Go (AWS SDK v2):

```go
client := s3.New(s3.Options{
	Region:       "us-east-1",
	BaseEndpoint: aws.String("http://localhost:9000"),
	UsePathStyle: true,
	Credentials:  credentials.NewStaticCredentialsProvider("test", "test", ""),
})
```

JavaScript (AWS SDK v3):

```js
const client = new S3Client({
  region: "us-east-1",
  endpoint: "http://localhost:9000",
  forcePathStyle: true,
  credentials: { accessKeyId: "test", secretAccessKey: "test" },
});
```

Browsers can upload to and download from presigned URLs directly: CORS allows
any origin, and response headers such as `ETag` are exposed.

## Supported operations

- **Buckets:** ListBuckets, CreateBucket, HeadBucket, DeleteBucket,
  GetBucketLocation, GetBucketVersioning (always unversioned).
- **Listing:** ListObjectsV2 and ListObjects (v1), with prefix, delimiter,
  paging and `encoding-type=url`.
- **Objects:** PutObject (including aws-chunked streaming uploads), GetObject
  (ranges, `partNumber`, `response-*` overrides, conditional GETs), HeadObject,
  CopyObject (`COPY` and `REPLACE` metadata directives), DeleteObject,
  DeleteObjects.
- **Multipart uploads:** CreateMultipartUpload, UploadPart,
  CompleteMultipartUpload, AbortMultipartUpload, ListParts,
  ListMultipartUploads. ETags and the 5 MiB minimum part size follow S3.
- **Conditional writes:** `If-None-Match: *` and `If-Match` on PutObject,
  CopyObject and CompleteMultipartUpload.
- **Presigned URLs** for GET and PUT.
- **Metadata:** `x-amz-meta-*` user metadata and the `Cache-Control`,
  `Content-Disposition`, `Content-Encoding`, `Content-Language` and `Expires`
  headers.

## Differences from S3

- **Keys.** Keys are opaque strings, as on S3: `a` and `a/b` coexist, and
  folder markers and `.` or `..` segments are ordinary keys. A key must be 1
  to 1024 bytes of valid UTF-8 and must not end in a `.` segment (`a/.`);
  other keys are rejected with `400 InvalidArgument`.
- **Storage layout.** Objects are stored by the gas `storage/dir` backend
  under hashed names, so the storage root is not browsable as files.
  Directories written by earlier versions are not readable by this one, and
  the server refuses to start on one. To keep their objects, serve the old
  volume with the previous image and a fresh one with this image, then copy
  each bucket through a local directory (`aws s3 sync` takes one endpoint per
  run):

  ```sh
  docker run -d --name old -p 9000:9000 -v s3data:/data \
    -e TULE_Auth_AccessKeyID=test -e TULE_Auth_SecretAccessKey=test \
    ghcr.io/tulehq/object-store:0.3.1
  docker run -d --name new -p 9001:9000 -v s3data-new:/data \
    -e TULE_Auth_AccessKeyID=test -e TULE_Auth_SecretAccessKey=test \
    ghcr.io/tulehq/object-store:latest
  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test AWS_REGION=us-east-1
  for b in $(aws s3 ls --endpoint-url http://localhost:9000 | awk '{print $3}'); do
    aws s3 sync "s3://$b" "copy/$b" --endpoint-url http://localhost:9000
    aws s3 mb "s3://$b" --endpoint-url http://localhost:9001
    aws s3 sync "copy/$b" "s3://$b" --endpoint-url http://localhost:9001
  done
  ```

  The copies keep their keys and contents. User metadata, system headers and
  modification times are not copied, and content types are guessed again from
  the file names.
- **Signature verification is request-level.** Header and presigned-URL
  signatures, expiry, clock skew and hex payload hashes are checked; the
  per-chunk signatures of streaming uploads are not, so a DeleteObjects or
  CompleteMultipartUpload document sent with signed chunks
  (`STREAMING-AWS4-*`) is refused with `400 InvalidRequest`. A body is
  decoded as aws-chunked only under a `STREAMING-*` `x-amz-content-sha256`;
  `Content-Encoding: aws-chunked` with any other value is refused with `400
  InvalidRequest`. There is one access key, with access to everything. As
  on S3, a request is refused when it carries an `x-amz-*` header it did not
  sign (`403 AccessDenied`), when its
  `SignedHeaders` are not lowercase, sorted and unique, when it is signed for
  a service other than `s3`, when its `x-amz-content-sha256` is not a hex
  SHA-256, `UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD` or `STREAMING-*` (`400 InvalidArgument`), and
  when a presigned URL is dated more than 15 minutes ahead (`403
  AccessDenied`, "Request is not yet valid"). The signature must cover
  `Host`. Unlike S3:
  - the credential's region is not checked, so clients may sign for any
    region;
  - any session token is refused with `400 InvalidToken`, since there are no
    temporary credentials;
  - a DeleteObjects or CompleteMultipartUpload document over 2 MiB is
    refused with `400 MaxMessageLengthExceeded`. One signed with a hex
    `x-amz-content-sha256` is verified before it is acted on; one sent as
    `UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD` or `STREAMING-UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD-TRAILER` is read as
    sent, as on S3.
- **Presigned DeleteObjects and CompleteMultipartUpload URLs sign no body**,
  as on S3. Whoever holds such a URL chooses the document it sends, so the
  URL is a bearer grant over every key in the bucket for that operation:
  any keys to delete, or any of the upload's parts to complete.
- **Not implemented** (requests return `501 NotImplemented`): enabling
  versioning, tagging, ACLs, bucket policies, CORS and lifecycle configuration,
  object lock, UploadPartCopy, and browser POST-policy uploads.
- **Accepted but ignored:** server-side encryption headers,
  `x-amz-copy-source-if-*` conditions, and additional checksums
  (`x-amz-checksum-*`, neither verified nor returned).
- HeadObject ignores conditional request headers.
