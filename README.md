# object-store

An S3-compatible object store that keeps objects on the local filesystem. It is
built to stand in for S3 in local development and end-to-end tests: point an
AWS SDK at it and the usual bucket, object, multipart and presigned-URL calls
work.

It is not a production object store. There is one storage root on one machine,
no replication, and listings read the bucket's whole key index on every call.

## Running it

With Docker:

```sh
docker run --rm -p 9000:9000 -v s3data:/data \
  -e TULE_Auth_AccessKeyID=test -e TULE_Auth_SecretAccessKey=test \
  -e TULE_Storage_Buckets=uploads,assets \
  ghcr.io/tulehq/object-store:latest
```

The image is based on Alpine, so `docker exec -it <container> sh` gives you a
shell. It runs as the unprivileged `nonroot` user, and its Docker health check
polls `/_ready`.

From source (Go 1.27):

```sh
make build
TULE_Auth_AccessKeyID=test TULE_Auth_SecretAccessKey=test ./build/tule-object-store
```

It listens on port 9000.

## Configuration

Settings come from environment variables prefixed with `TULE_`, and from a
`.env` file in the working directory (without the prefix).

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TULE_Server_Port` | `9000` | Listen port |
| `TULE_Storage_RootDir` | `./data` (`/data` in the image) | Where buckets and objects are stored |
| `TULE_Storage_Buckets` | unset | Comma-separated buckets to create at startup, if missing |
| `TULE_HSTS_MaxAge` | unset | `Strict-Transport-Security` max age; the header is only sent when set |
| `TULE_Server_Domain` | `localhost` | Enables virtual-hosted-style requests to `<bucket>.<domain>` |
| `TULE_Server_ReadTimeout` | `0` | How long the server may take to read a whole request, `0` for no limit, so an upload streams for as long as the client needs |
| `TULE_Server_WriteTimeout` | `0` | How long it may take to write a whole response, `0` for no limit, so a download does too |
| `TULE_Auth_AccessKeyID` | required | The access key clients sign requests with |
| `TULE_Auth_SecretAccessKey` | required | Its secret |
| `TULE_GasEnv` | | `development` logs at trace level, `testing` disables logging |

The server refuses to start without credentials, and every request must be
signed with them (SigV4) or carry a presigned URL made with them. Any web page
you visit can send requests to a server on localhost; signatures are what stop
it from using this one.

## Health checks

`GET /_health` (liveness) and `GET /_ready` (readiness) answer without a
signature. They respond `200` when every service reports healthy or ready and
`503` otherwise, with a JSON object of each service's status. Readiness fails
when the storage root cannot be read.

Startup buckets are created before the server listens, so once either probe
answers, they exist.

## Connecting a client

Use any region; buckets report `us-east-1`. Path-style addressing always
works. Virtual-hosted style works when the client can resolve
`<bucket>.<TULE_Server_Domain>` to the server.

Go (AWS SDK v2):

```go
client := s3.New(s3.Options{
	Region:       "us-east-1",
	BaseEndpoint: aws.String("http://localhost:9000"),
	UsePathStyle: true,
	Credentials:  credentials.NewStaticCredentialsProvider("test", "test", ""),
})
```

JavaScript (AWS SDK v3):

```js
const client = new S3Client({
  region: "us-east-1",
  endpoint: "http://localhost:9000",
  forcePathStyle: true,
  credentials: { accessKeyId: "test", secretAccessKey: "test" },
});
```

Browsers can upload to and download from presigned URLs directly: CORS allows
any origin, and response headers such as `ETag` are exposed.

## Supported operations

- **Buckets:** ListBuckets, CreateBucket, HeadBucket, DeleteBucket,
  GetBucketLocation, GetBucketVersioning (always unversioned).
- **Listing:** ListObjectsV2 and ListObjects (v1), with prefix, delimiter,
  paging and `encoding-type=url`.
- **Objects:** PutObject (including aws-chunked streaming uploads), GetObject
  (ranges, `partNumber`, `response-*` overrides, conditional GETs), HeadObject,
  CopyObject (`COPY` and `REPLACE` metadata directives), DeleteObject,
  DeleteObjects.
- **Multipart uploads:** CreateMultipartUpload, UploadPart,
  CompleteMultipartUpload, AbortMultipartUpload, ListParts,
  ListMultipartUploads. ETags and the 5 MiB minimum part size follow S3.
- **Conditional writes:** `If-None-Match: *` and `If-Match` on PutObject,
  CopyObject and CompleteMultipartUpload.
- **Presigned URLs** for GET and PUT.
- **Metadata:** `x-amz-meta-*` user metadata and the `Cache-Control`,
  `Content-Disposition`, `Content-Encoding`, `Content-Language` and `Expires`
  headers.

## Differences from S3

- **Keys.** Keys are opaque strings, as on S3: `a` and `a/b` coexist, and
  folder markers and `.` or `..` segments are ordinary keys. A key must be 1
  to 1024 bytes of valid UTF-8 and must not end in a `.` segment (`a/.`);
  other keys are rejected with `400 InvalidArgument`.
- **Storage layout.** Objects are stored by the gas `storage/dir` backend
  under hashed names, so the storage root is not browsable as files.
  Directories written by earlier versions, which stored keys as file paths,
  are not readable by this one.
- **Signature verification is request-level.** Header and presigned-URL
  signatures, expiry, clock skew and hex payload hashes are checked; the
  per-chunk signatures of streaming uploads are not. There is one access key,
  with access to everything.
- **Not implemented** (requests return `501 NotImplemented`): enabling
  versioning, tagging, ACLs, bucket policies, CORS and lifecycle configuration,
  object lock, UploadPartCopy, and browser POST-policy uploads.
- **Accepted but ignored:** server-side encryption headers,
  `x-amz-copy-source-if-*` conditions, and additional checksums
  (`x-amz-checksum-*`, neither verified nor returned).
- HeadObject ignores conditional request headers.

## Development

```sh
make test       # unit tests
make test-e2e   # end-to-end tests: the app in-process, driven by the AWS SDK
make lint
make image      # build ghcr.io/tulehq/object-store:dev
make smoke      # build the image, run it, and check it serves signed requests
make push VERSION=0.1.0   # build for amd64 and arm64 and push
```
